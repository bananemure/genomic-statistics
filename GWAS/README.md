GWAS
==================
This repository contains R scripts and several walk-through examples of how to use those scripts to do custom analysis of genome wide association study,

The R scripts are based on different approaches of GWAS analysis: - one of the approaches is based on the old deprecated "*__genetics__*" R-package 
to carry exploratory analysis and association tests. - the other approaches use the "*__genabel__*" R-package which is recommended and suited for GWAS analysis.
